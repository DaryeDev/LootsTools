# LootsTrading

**LootsTrading** is an [Addicional Feature](..) which enables the **Sharing** and **Copying** of *Cards* and *Collections*, **including** the *Cards* commands (*Normal* and *Advanced*), with the respective Dependencies and EXtensions (with [LaTEX](../../additionalFeatures/latex)).

---

## Installation

As for all the [Addicional Features](..), on the first startup you'll be prompted whether you want to install this *Additional Feature*.

It will only take a few seconds, and it'll be done!

However, if you want to install them later, you can do it running, on your ```Loot's Tools Folder```, the following command:

```.\LootsTools.exe installAdditionalFeatures```

---

## Usage

**LootsTrading** works by URL sharing, lets start with Sharing *Cards* and *Collections*, to then learn how to Copy them:

---

### Sharing Cards

In order to share a *Card*, you need to [click here](lootstools://shareCard) or open this on your Browser: ```lootstools://shareCard```

Then, it'll ask you to use the *Card* you want to Share, and the Commands, files and Configuration of the *Card* will be uploaded.

It'll finish giving you a **LootsTrading Card URL**, and with that you can Share your *Card* with others!

---

### Sharing Collections

To share a *Collection* you'll need to [click here](lootstools://shareCollection) or open this on your Browser: ```lootstools://shareCollection```

Like with [Sharing Cards](#sharing-cards), it'll then ask you to use a *Card*, but this time to detect the *Collection*. 

When it's finished, it'll give you a **LootsTrading Collection URL** to Share your incredible *Collection* with everyone on the Internet (As long as they have **LootsTrading** enabled ;D) !

---

### Copying Cards

To copy a *Card*, you'll need a **LootsTrading Card URL**. Don't worry if you don't have one, I'll give you one of mines: 

[[Alt+F4](lootstools://copyCard/5fb7e18069cff0003945a512)]

Once you have a **LootsTrading Card URL**, open it and use a *Card* of the *Collection* you want this new *Card* to be in.

All the images, sounds, configurations, commands and information of the *Card* will be transfered to you.

As simple as that. Open **Streamloots** and see your new *Card* on your selected *Collection*! 

---

### Copying Collections

Copying *Collections* is, like the rest of the methods, very easy.

For this one, you only need a **LootsTrading Collection URL**, here, have one of mine: 

[[Minecraft Collection](lootstools://copyCollection/5fa6b8cfc365890037cce144)]

Open it, let **LootsTrading** do its Magic, and that's it! 

Open **Streamloots** and see your newly created *Collection*! 

(Note: When Copying a *Collection*, all cards, by default, are hidden. Publish them to use them.)
