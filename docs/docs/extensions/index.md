# Introduction to EXtensions

<sup style="font-size: 90%">(This is a feature unlocked with [***Loot's Tools Plus***](../../plus). A ***Plus*** Account is required.)</sup>

*EXtensions* are, as the name suggests, extensions for ***Loot's Tools***. 

They can provide more Commands for [Normal Cards](../cards/normalCards.md), useful functions for [Advanced Cards](../cards/advCards.md) or even completely new Interpreters (for Cards).
