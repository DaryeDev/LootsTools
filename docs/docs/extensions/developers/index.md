# Create EXtensions

<sup style="font-size: 90%">(This is a feature unlocked with [***Loot's Tools Plus***](../../plus). A ***Plus*** Account is required.)</sup>

The easiest way to create EXtensions is by using the Create function of [LaTEX](../../additionalFeatures/latex/), and then modifying the template.

You can Create an EXtension [clicking here](ltex://create).

A better guide on how to create EXtensions is soon to be written, contact Darye on Discord if you are interested.
