# Create EXtensions

<sup style="font-size: 90%">(This is a feature unlocked with [***Loot's Tools Plus***](../../plus). A ***Plus*** Account is required.)</sup>

The easiest way to create EXtensions is by using the Create function of [LaTEX](../../additionalFeatures/latex/), and then modifying the template.

You can Create an EXtension [clicking here](https://lootstrading.darye.dev/latex/new).

(This requires [LaTEX](../../additionalFeatures/latex) enabled. If you don't have it enabled, install the Additional Features [here](../../additionalFeatures#Installation/).)
