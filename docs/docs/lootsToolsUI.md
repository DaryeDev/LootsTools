</a>
Introduced on v2, ***Loot's Tools UI*** offers a new and friendlier way to use ***Loot's Tools***. 

You can access it on [lootstools.darye.dev](https://lootstools.darye.dev).

Opening the UI opens the **Loot's Tools Console**, if necessary; and opening the **Loot's Tools Console**, from the executable, opens the UI on load.

## Pages

The UI is divided on pages:

- [Home](#home)

- [Cards](#cards)

- [EXtensions](#extensions)

- [Log](#log)

- [User](#user)

### Cards

The **Cards Page** offers a glimpse at the Cards of your Streamloots Collections, categorized by them. 

The Name and Icon of the Card is shown on a grid, and Enhanced Cards are marked with a star on the top-left corner.

Clicking on a Card offers the options to test the Card and other to open the Card's folder to edit its files.

Also, this page has two buttons, the **Enhance** Button (<ion-icon name="add-circle-outline"></ion-icon>), that makes a Card Enhanced, and the **Reload** Button (<ion-icon name="refresh-circle-outline"></ion-icon>), that reloads the Cards (Names, pictures and states).

### EXtensions

The **Log Page** shows the output of the **Loot's Tools Console**, with an auto scroll option.

### User

## Exiting the UI

Aside of closing the browser tab or window, the UI has an **Exit** button. (<ion-icon name="exit-outline"></ion-icon>).

On click, this button pops up a prompt to **Close only the UI** or **Close also the Loot's Tools Console**:
