Chat always likes to troll a bit, and nothing is worse than literally letting them close the stream your people are watching. This can be achieved by EXtensions , a feature of Loot's Tools Plus , and in this case, we will be using the OBS one, which allows control over this streaming tool on things like ending stream, changing source settings, changing texts... To cut off the stream with a Card, this is the command it has to execute: OBSSTREAMING end (You can always use as many Commands as you want, obviously, but I focused the examples on fun little commands that will refresh your streams.) Commands By default, Loot's Tools offers a selection of Commands: CHEST This Command allows the Streamer to gift a certain amount of Packs of a given collection to a user. Usage CHEST {user} {quantity} {collectionName} Arguments user [str]: The user to gift the Pack to. quantity [int]: The amount of Packs to gift. collectionName [str] (Optional): The Collection you want the Pack to be of. If not given, it defaults to the main Collection. WRITE This Command simulates being the keyboard and writes the given string. Usage WRITE {text} Arguments text [str]: The string to be written. RUN This Command runs a program. Usage RUN {path} Arguments path [str]: The path to the program to run. SEND This Command simulates being the keyboard and sends a key combination. Usage RUN {keyCombination} Arguments keyCombination [str]: The key combination to send. WAIT This Command waits x seconds to resume execution of the Card's Commands. Usage WAIT {seconds} Arguments seconds [int]: The number of seconds to wait. RND This Command chooses a random item from a list and saves it to a Tag . Usage RND({tagName}) {itemList} Arguments tagName [str]: The Tag name to save the value into. itemList [list]: The list of items to choose from, they have to be separated by \", \" (A colon and a space). Example: item1, item2, item3 PRINT This Command prints on the Loot's Tools Console Log. Usage PRINT {text} Arguments text [str]: The text to print. Tags Tags are a way to introduce variables on Commands when making them, let's see what Tags are available: {user} This Tag is substituted by the user that redeemed the Card, useful for gifting Packs or making personalized rewards. {streamer} This Tag is substituted by the Streamer that the user is redeeming the Card on. {cardName} This Tag is substituted by the name of the Card redeemed. {rarity} This Tag is substituted by the name of the rarity of Card redeemed. (Possible values: common , rare , epic or legendary ) Additional Tags If the Card requires input, the input's internal name can be used as a Tag . For example: In this Card, an additional Tag would be {message} .
