# Loot's Tools Browser Companion

<center>

The **Loot's Tools Browser Companion** is a browser extension available for Chromium-based browsers to **enhance [Streamloots'](https://streamloots.com){target=_blank} site and use**, and **sync your different accounts with your Streamloots' one** on the Loot's Tools Suite.

Syncing your accounts with your Streamloots' one can be used for having an Exclusive Role on your Favourite Creator's Discord Server when using a Card, or receiving Packs when redeeming Twitch Channel Points Rewards.

Streamloots Enhancements include more types of user input when redeeming a Card, such as selecting Dropdown options, sending Files or Images, or inputting Numbers.
