Note The Overlay will not work on Fullscreen apps or games. Borderless Gaming is your friend here to execute your app or game in windowed borderless mode. Add images To add images to the list of Overlays you will only need to drop them on the Overlay Folder on your Loot's Tools Folder. Go to the Overlay Page on the UI and click on \"Open Overlay Page\", this will open the Overlay Folder. Drop there your images and et voil\u00e0! , that image will be ready to select on Commands.

Toggle Overlays Once we get our image files loaded, to toggle the Overlays with Commands we'll need to go to the Editor, edit any Card or Event, and Enable the Overlay, then wait x seconds, and finally Disable it.

This way it can be later enabled or disabled with Commands on normal Cards . If you are interested on toggling Overlays on Advanced Cards or EXtensions . Toggle Overlays with Advanced Cards or EXtensions Now that we have created our Overlay, we'll need to enable and disable it, right?

As this guide is focused on new users, we will start from the absolute start. If you are only interested on a part of the Guide, you can skip to your point of interest on the Index. Gifting Streamloots\u2019 Packs is one of most requested feature on Streamloots Automations, but with Loot's Tools it can be done easy, quick and simple. Let me take you through the process of incorporating this into your Streams, with some examples and some insights on Loot's Tools, to meet this tool and learn about some of the things it can do for you. Install Loot\u2019s Tools First of all, we'll need to install and setup Loot's Tools. Loot's Tools is an automation tool focused on Streamloots , made by a Content Creator, for Content Creators. However, Loot's Tools can automate much more than only Streamloots Cards, like Subscriptions or Packs Purchases, or, outside of Streamloots for example, Twitch Channel Points Rewards, Chat Messages and Commands, Subscriptions or Donations, but we'll talk about it later. Find out how to install and set it up here: Getting Started Test Gifting and how to make Pack-gifting Cards You have Loot's Tools installed? Great! Let's get on Gifting Packs here. Let's first learn how to edit Cards and Events: Let's make a Card that Gifts a Pack Enhance a Card to test , then edit its Commands by clicking on the Card and selecting \u201cEdit Card Commands\u201d. Press TAB and choose \u201c Gift Pack \u201d. With that Command we can choose the number of Packs we want to gift, the Collection they are from , who to give them to , and how many Cards they have (1-3). On Giftee\u2019s username, we\u2019d like to tell Loot\u2019s Tools to give it to who had used the Card, so we\u2019ll use Tags , to introduce variables on Commands In this case, we\u2019ll use {user} , which will be changed for the user that used that Card when the Command executes. Save your Card. So let's test it, shall we? You can do it from Streamloots or directly from Loot\u2019s Tools (Clicking the Card and then on \" Test Card \"). If we go now to Streamloots, we will see that the user that used the Card will have received a Pack. Note: If you won\u2019t be using this Card for Gifting Packs, I\u2019d delete its commands, just in case. Ok, but how could we do it with Channel Points? Before anything, to use Commands on Events such as Channel Points Redeems on Twitch, we\u2019ll need Twitch's EXtension . EXtensions and Loot\u2019s Tools Plus EXtensions are for expanding the uses of Loot's Tools , like sending Messages to Twitch Chat, doing stuff on OBS , executing commands on Minecraft , or, what is of our interest now, Automating Channel Points . Using EXtensions requires a Plus account , so we\u2019ll need to upgrade our account before continuing if it isn\u2019t yet. If you want to upgrade, you can do it by clicking on \u201c Upgrade to Plus \u201d when the popup opens when opening Loot\u2019s Tools. \u2026 or by clicking on \u201c Upgrade to Plus \u201d on the User\u2019s Page on the UI: Upgrading to Plus also unlock Events that execute Commands , like Pack Purchases and Gifts (Also to the Community) or Streamloots Subscriptions, as we said earlier, using EXtensions and making more use of the tool; the ability to use Python Scripts on Events (Like Card redemptions, the aforementioned, and those given by EXtensions); and also you support the development of Loot\u2019s Tools and EXtensions . Installing Twitch\u2019s EXtension Installing EXtensions is extremely easy: Simply click a link. In Twitch\u2019s case, and if you have a Plus Account, you can install it with the following link: Install LootsToolsEX for Twitch When it installs, it will open a new tab on your browser, asking you for permission for \u201cLootsToolsBot\u201d, Loot\u2019s Tools\u2019 Bot on Twitch, to do its job. Once allowed, Events such as Messages sent to chat, Chat Commands that you can configure on the EXtension\u2019s Page on the UI, Channel Point Rewards redeems, Bits Donations, and Subscriptions will be available to automate with Loot\u2019s Tools Remember the Card we did before\u2026 With it, we could gift a Pack to the person that used it. With Channel Points, this will be similar, but we\u2019ll need to change a couple of things. We\u2019ll open Loot\u2019s Tools Editor, on the Cards\u2019 Page on the UI, and we\u2019ll select on the top part dropdown the Channel Point Reward we want to automate, in my case, that will be \u201cCofresito\u201d. When we are on this Event on the Editor, we will do the same as with the Card before: New Command, \u201cGift Pack\u201d, select the Collection, but this time we\u2019ll need to change the user. This Event saves the username of who was redeemed the Reward on the variable, or Tag , \u201ctwitchChannelPointUser\u201d. So, if we wanted it to gift a Pack to those who have redeemed the Reward, on the user we\u2019ll need to write {twitchChannelPointUser}. Testing time If we now test this Channel Point Reward on our Twitch Chat, a Pack will be given to us on your Streamloots Page. Epilogue: More things with Twitch\u2019s EXtension With it, we said we could receive more Events, such as, for example, Subs I have on my channel a promotion also found on many other channels: 1 Free Pack to those who sub . This would be made the same way as the Channel Point Reward one, but with the Twitch Sub Event and the user being this time {twitchSubUserName} . You can find the Events and Commands of Twitch\u2019s EXtension here: LootsToolsEX for Twitch ; and the rest of EXtensions here: EXtensions If you have any issues or questions, don\u2019t hesitate on sending me a message at Darye.#1315 on Discord or on my Discord Server: DaryeHub","title":"Gift Packs with Twitch Channel Points"},{"location":"guides/packsChannelPoints/index.html#gift-packs-with-twitch-channel-points","text":"Note This is meant to be taken as a Start Guide for those that want to Gift Streamloots' Packs with Twitch Channel Points, and then explore the tool deeply.
